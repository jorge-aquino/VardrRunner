"""
Recon pipeline definitions.

A pipeline is a named, ordered list of stages. Each stage runs a tool handler and
uploads its results to VardrMap; the next stage pulls those results via the `recon`
source. So `recon` chains subfinder (enumerate subdomains from wildcard scope) →
httpx (probe the discovered hosts) → nuclei (scan the live ones), each handing off
to the next through the backend's recon store.

Add a pipeline by adding an entry here — stages reference handlers in the registry.
