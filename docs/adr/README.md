# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory records non-trivial design decisions for VardrRunner. Each ADR captures the
context, the decision, and its consequences so future work understands *why* the code looks
the way it does.

## Conventions
- One file per decision: `NNNN-short-kebab-title.md` (zero-padded, sequential).
- Never delete an ADR. To reverse one, add a new ADR and mark the old one **Superseded**.
- Use [`0000-template.md`](0000-template.md) as the starting point.
