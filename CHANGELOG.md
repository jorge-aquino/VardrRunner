# Changelog

All notable changes to VardrRunner are documented here.
This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Per-version detail notes live in [`changelog/`](changelog/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.24.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **`pipeline run --dry-run`.**  Resolves first-stage targets and prints the planned tool chain without executing any tool. Useful for validating scope and target counts before committing to a long pipeline run.
- **`pipeline run --json`.**  Emits a machine-readable JSON result after the pipeline completes — run ID, per-stage status/targets/summary/elapsed, and an overall `success` flag. Designed for CI scripts that need to inspect pipeline results programmatically.

### Fixed
- **Daemon log files no longer contain Rich markup brackets.** The file-mode `Console` was created with `markup=False`, which caused `[green]`, `[dim]`, and similar tags to appear literally in log files. Removing that flag lets Rich render markup to plain text automatically since the log file is not a terminal. `_RotatingLogFile` now also implements `isatty() → False` explicitly.
- **Daemon poll backs off exponentially on consecutive errors.** A downed backend was previously retried every `poll_interval` seconds regardless of failure count. The daemon now backs off exponentially (5 s → 10 s → 20 s … capped at 5 min) and resets on the next successful poll. The error message now includes the retry delay.
- **`_extract_jsonl_field` OSError now logged as a warning** instead of silently swallowed. Disk-full or permissions failures are now visible in log aggregation.
- **Collapsed redundant exception handlers in `_run_stage`.** `ToolTimeout` is a subclass of `Exception`; both handlers returned the same result shape, so the separate branch was dead code.

### Changed
- **Subfinder and Dnsx `execute()` use a shared `_write_host_import_jsonl()` helper.** Both handlers duplicated the same JSONL conversion loop. Extracted to a module-level helper in `handlers.py`.

## [0.23.0] — 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Live TUI for `pipeline run`.** Each stage is now a live-updating table row
  (Rich `Live` + `Table`) with a spinner while running and final status icons
  (✓ done, ✗ failed, ⊘ no targets, — aborted) plus target count, result summary,
  and elapsed time per stage. Remaining stages are marked aborted immediately when
  a stage stops the pipeline.

### Changed
- `_run_stage` now returns a structured `_StageResult` dataclass instead of
  printing directly, keeping all display logic in `_PipelineTUI`.

## [0.22.2] — 2026-06-20

### Changed
- **Operational logging in silent paths.** `_emit()` in `jobs.py`, `heartbeat.py`
  quiet mode, and the daemon all now emit `logging.warning()` on failures instead of
  silently swallowing errors, making issues visible in log aggregation without breaking
  quiet operation.
- **VARDRRUNNER_TOOL_TIMEOUT validation.** Invalid values now log a warning and fall
  back to the default instead of silently being ignored.
- **Keychain failures logged at DEBUG level.** `available()`, `get_key()`, `set_key()`,
  and `delete_key()` all emit structured debug logs on exception so operators can
  diagnose keyring backend issues.
- **Handler method signatures.** All `ToolHandler` concrete methods are now annotated
  with their specific config types (e.g. `configs.HttpxConfig`) instead of `Any`,
  catching config/handler mismatches at type-check time.
- **JSONL parsing deduplicated.** Shared `_extract_jsonl_field()` utility replaces three
  identical implementations across `HttpxHandler`, `SubfinderHandler`, and `DnsxHandler`.

### Added
- **`bandit` security scan in CI.** `bandit -r vardrrunner -ll -q` runs in the lint job
  on every push, blocking merges on high/medium severity findings.
- **Coverage threshold raised to 95%.** `pytest --cov-fail-under=95`; new test files
  cover `api.py` HTTP methods, `keychain.py`, `commands/auth.py`, `commands/programs.py`,
  `commands/heartbeat.py`, `cli.py` (via `typer.testing.CliRunner`), and the full
  job lifecycle edge cases (malformed job, unknown tool, config error, target resolution
  failure, claim race, no output, `ToolTimeout`, generic exception).

## [0.22.1] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **`--max-targets` guardrail on `pipeline run` and all `run <tool>` commands.**
  If the resolved target count exceeds the limit the command aborts before running
  any tool, printing the count and telling the operator how to raise or disable the
  cap. Default is 500; pass `--max-targets 0` to disable. The check applies even
  with `--yes` so automation pipelines can't accidentally scan thousands of hosts.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Daemon log rotation.** When `--log-file` is specified, log output is now written
  through a `RotatingFileHandler` (5 MB per file, 3 backup files) instead of an
  unbounded append-only file. Prevents runaway disk use on long-lived VPS daemons.
- **Daemon log timestamps.** Every line written to the log file is prefixed with an
  ISO 8601 timestamp (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`) so operators can correlate events and
  grep logs by time without relying on filesystem metadata.

## [0.21.1] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **`import` command no longer lists `ffuf` as supported.** `ffuf` has no handler,
  no backend importer, and would fail at runtime. `SUPPORTED_TOOLS` is now `["httpx",
  "nuclei"]` — the two formats the backend's file-import endpoint actually accepts.
  `subfinder`/`dnsx` are excluded because they convert to httpx-format JSONL before
  uploading; `nmap`/`naabu` use `create_services`, not file import.
- **Run directories are pruned automatically.** `_make_run_dir()` now deletes run
  directories older than 7 days before creating a new one, so pipeline artifacts don't
  accumulate indefinitely on long-running VPS daemons.

### Changed
- **`pipeline list` now shows each stage's data source.** Output is now
  `subfinder(scope) → httpx(recon) → nuclei(recon)` so operators can see data flow
  at a glance without reading the source code.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-06-20
Run-scoped pipeline isolation. See [changelog/v0.21.0.md](changelog/v0.21.0.md) for details.

### Added
- **Run-scoped pipeline isolation.** Each `pipeline run` now generates a short run ID
  (`8-hex`) printed at the start and end. After every stage completes, its discovered
  targets are extracted from the output and written to a local **handoff file**; the next
  stage reads from that file instead of the shared backend recon store. This prevents stale
  recon from earlier runs contaminating later stages.
- **`ToolHandler.extract_handoff_targets(output)`** — new method on every handler, returns
  the targets that stage produced for the next stage. `HttpxHandler` extracts URLs/hosts
  from its JSONL; `SubfinderHandler` and `DnsxHandler` extract hostnames. Terminal handlers
  (nuclei, nmap, naabu) return `[]` and fall back to backend resolution.
- **`ToolHandler.normalize_handoff_targets(targets)`** — new method that strips URL
  scheme/path for host-only tools (nmap, dnsx, naabu), matching what their
  `resolve_targets()` does for backend recon. Default is identity.
- **ADR 0005** documents the design decision. See `docs/adr/0005-run-scoped-pipelines.md`.

### Changed
- `commands/pipeline._run_stage()` return type changed from `bool` to
  `tuple[bool, Path | None]`. No public API change — `_run_stage` is internal.

## [0.20.1] — 2026-06-20
Reliability hardening. See [changelog/v0.20.1.md](changelog/v0.20.1.md) for details.

### Fixed
- **Recon pagination.** `api.recon()` now paginates in chunks of 500 instead of issuing one
  request with the caller's `limit`. Eliminates the live 422 seen at `limit=736` and makes
  large recon sets reliable for httpx, nuclei, naabu, and pipelines.
- **Tool failures are now fatal.** `runner._run_tool()` raises `ToolError` on any non-zero exit
  code; every `run_*` function signature changed from `-> int` to `-> None`. A failed httpx,
  nuclei, subfinder, dnsx, nmap, or naabu run marks the job **failed** with the exit code
  rather than silently drifting into "done".
- **`doctor` skips auth after an invalid backend URL.** `_check_auth()` now validates the URL
  before making any network call, returning a WARN instead of a noisy follow-up failure.
- **Corrupt config file is handled gracefully.** `config.load()` raises `InvalidConfigFile`
  (not a raw `JSONDecodeError`) on malformed JSON. `doctor._collect()` catches it, emits one
  clear FAIL check with a remediation hint, and continues running tool/disk/daemon checks.
- **`nmap` version detection fixed.** `tool_version()` now uses `--version` for nmap (was
  `-version`) and falls back to a `X.Y.Z`-style regex in addition to `vX.Y.Z`, so nmap,
  dnsx, and naabu report actual version numbers instead of "unknown".

## [0.20.0] — 2026-06-17
Secure credentials + broader recon coverage. See
[changelog/v0.20.0.md](changelog/v0.20.0.md) for the rollup.

### Added
- **dnsx + naabu tools.** Two new recon tools via the handler registry:
  - `dnsx` (`vardrrunner run dnsx`) resolves hosts and uploads only the **resolvable** ones as
    recon targets, so later httpx/nuclei passes don't waste time on dead names.
  - `naabu` (`vardrrunner run naabu`) does a fast top-ports scan and uploads open ports to the
    services API (`source: "naabu"`).
  - Two new pipelines: `deep` (subfinder → dnsx → httpx → nuclei) and `ports`
    (subfinder → dnsx → naabu). `doctor`/`status`/heartbeat pick up both tools automatically.
- **OS keychain credential storage.** `vardrrunner login` now stores your API key in the OS
  keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Locker, Linux Secret Service) by default, with
  the backend URL kept in `config.json`. Key resolution is `VARDRMAP_API_KEY` env > keychain >
  legacy config file. On a headless box with no keyring backend it falls back to the plaintext
  config file with a warning, so servers keep working. See
  [docs/adr/0004-credential-storage.md](docs/adr/0004-credential-storage.md).
- **`vardrrunner logout`** — removes the stored key from the keychain and config file, leaves
  the API URL in place, and warns if `VARDRMAP_API_KEY` is still set in the environment.
### Changed
- `doctor` reports the **credential source** (`environment` / `keychain` / `config file`)
  without exposing the secret, and only warns about config-file permissions when the file
  actually holds a plaintext key.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-06-17
First feature release from the standalone repo. See
[changelog/v0.19.0.md](changelog/v0.19.0.md) for the rollup.

### Added
- **`vardrrunner doctor`.** A deep preflight for unattended/VPS use, distinct from `status`'s
  quick glance: it exits 0 only when the runner is healthy enough to work, exits non-zero on
  actionable failures, and prints remediation per problem (so `doctor && daemon start` gates
  provisioning). Checks credential source, backend URL validity, config-file permissions, API
  auth, daemon PID health, run-dir writability, free disk, tool versions, and pipeline
  readiness. `--json` emits a machine-readable report.
- **Recon pipelines.** `vardrrunner pipeline run recon --program <id>` chains tools in one
  command — `recon` = subfinder → httpx → nuclei, `quick` = subfinder → httpx. Each stage
  uploads its results so the next pulls them from the recon store; the run preflights tool
  availability, validates the nuclei `--severity` filter up front, stops early on an empty
  stage, and supports `--continue-on-error`. `vardrrunner pipeline list` shows the chains.
  Built on the handler registry — a pipeline is just an ordered list of `Stage(tool, source)`.
- **Typed, validated job configs.** Tool configs (`limit`, `status_code`, `severity`,
  `templates`, `top_ports`, `timing`, `timeout`) are parsed into frozen dataclasses
  (`configs.py`) and validated up front. A malformed or drifted backend payload now fails
  the job fast with a clear message (e.g. out-of-range nmap timing, unknown nuclei severity)
  instead of blowing up mid-execution. A `JobEnvelope` likewise validates the job wrapper
  (`id`/`tool_type`/`target_source`/`program_id`).
- **`vardrrunner run nmap`.** Direct service-discovery command (safe profile only), matching
  the existing nmap *job* support. `status` now lists every allowlisted tool (incl. nmap),
  so it can't drift from what the runner actually supports.
- **Environment-variable config.** `VARDRMAP_URL` and `VARDRMAP_API_KEY` override the
  config file (precedence: env > file), so containers, CI, and headless VPS daemons don't
  need a config file. `status` reflects the resolved source.
- **Per-tool run timeout.** Every tool subprocess now runs under a wall-clock limit
  (default 1800 s; override per job via `config.timeout`, or globally via
  `VARDRRUNNER_TOOL_TIMEOUT`). A hung tool is killed and the job marked **failed** instead
  of freezing the daemon forever.

### Changed
- **Tool-handler registry.** `execute_pending_jobs` (~290 lines of per-tool `if` branches)
  is refactored into a `ToolHandler` per job type (`handlers.py`) driven by one uniform
  lifecycle (`_execute_one`): capability check → config → targets → claim → events → upload
  → done/fail. Every tool now gets identical claim/event/failure handling, and adding a tool
  is a one-file change. See
  [docs/adr/0002-tool-handler-registry.md](docs/adr/0002-tool-handler-registry.md).
- **Direct `run` commands share the typed-config/handler path.** `run httpx|subfinder|nuclei|nmap`
  now validate their options through the same configs and reuse the same handlers as jobs and
  pipelines, so `run nmap --timing 9` is rejected (not silently clamped) and `run nuclei
  --severity bogus` fails before any work. Target resolution moved to `targets.py`.
- **Resilient API client.** The HTTP session now retries transient failures
  (connection errors and 429/500/502/503/504) with exponential backoff, so a
  long-running daemon survives network blips and brief backend restarts. Retries
  are limited to idempotent methods — POST/PATCH are never auto-retried, so a
  dropped response can't cause a double-claim, double-import, or duplicate event.
  Retry count and backoff are constructor-configurable. Requests also send a
  `User-Agent: vardrrunner/<version> (<os>)` header for backend attribution.

### Fixed
- **Pipeline `--continue-on-error` is now complete** — it also covers tool-execution and
  upload failures, not just target resolution and timeouts.
- **Malformed job envelopes fail cleanly.** A job missing a required field is marked failed
  (or skipped if it has no id) via `JobEnvelope`, instead of risking a `KeyError` mid-loop.

### Security
- **HTTPS enforced for the backend URL.** The runner refuses to send your `vmap_` API key
  over plain HTTP to a non-local host (allowed for `localhost`, or with
  `VARDRRUNNER_ALLOW_INSECURE=1`). Validated at login and on every authenticated call.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-06-14
First release from the standalone repository. See
[changelog/v0.18.0.md](changelog/v0.18.0.md) for detail.

### Changed
- Extracted VardrRunner into its own repository from the VardrMap monorepo, preserving
  full commit history via `git subtree split`. See
  [docs/adr/0001-extract-vardrrunner-from-vardrmap.md](docs/adr/0001-extract-vardrrunner-from-vardrmap.md).
- **Corrected the package version** from a misleading `0.1.0` to `0.18.0` (the package
  already carried v0.17.x of features). Version is now single-sourced from
  `vardrrunner/__init__.py` and read dynamically by `pyproject.toml`; the heartbeat reports it.
- Replaced `pyflakes` with **ruff** (lint + format) and added **mypy** type checking; all
  three plus coverage now run in CI on Python 3.10–3.12.

### Added
- Standalone repo scaffolding: `CLAUDE.md` (with the shared VardrSec Engineering Charter),
  `README.md`, `docs/` (architecture, development, CLI reference, ADRs), `changelog/`,
  CI workflow, and `.gitignore`.
- `LICENSE` (MIT).
- `[project.optional-dependencies] dev` extra in `pyproject.toml` — `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.

## History before extraction
The features below shipped while VardrRunner lived inside the VardrMap repo. They are
recorded here for continuity; their commits are present in this repo's history.

### v0.17.1 — Daemon Windows fixes
- ctypes liveness probe (Windows `os.kill` was terminating the daemon)
- PID-file-removal graceful stop protocol; `DETACHED_PROCESS` detach; double-start guard

### v0.17.0 — Daemon
- `daemon start/stop/status`; polls jobs every 5 s, heartbeats every 60 s on a dedicated
  thread; `--detach` background mode with PID file; graceful SIGTERM shutdown
- Extracted `execute_pending_jobs()` so one-shot and daemon share one execution path

### v0.15.0 — Radar, AI triage, normalization
- nmap job type; `strip_url_to_host()` target normalization

### v0.14.0 — Service discovery
- Atomic job claim via `POST /jobs/{id}/claim`; nmap job type (safe profile);
  per-tool config validation

### v0.13.0 — Job events
- Emits `started/targets_resolved/running/uploaded/done/failed` lifecycle events

### v0.12.0 — Real heartbeat
- `POST /runner/heartbeat`; reports hostname, version, OS, per-tool availability;
  explicit `heartbeat` command + auto-heartbeat on `jobs run`

### v0.11.0 — Job dispatch
- subfinder job dispatch (wildcard extraction → subfinder → JSONL → httpx import)

### v0.9.0 — VardrRunner v1
- subfinder support for wildcard scope; `jobs list` / `jobs run`; missing tool marks job
  failed instead of silently skipping; `status` command
